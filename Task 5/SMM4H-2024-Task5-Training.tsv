940933404912218114	@ShoePrincess89 I know 😂😂it’s like are you thick??? You can’t beat genetics, you can have the best pregnancy ever but if you carry the autistic gene which a lot of people do then there’s a chance you’ll have an autistic child nothing you can do to stop it!	0
995495972364005376	Okay ma’am, I know autism runs in my family. I know the signs to look for. The doctor says my son is doing everything he should and has no concerns. Plus, I’m in special education. Obviously, it wouldn’t matter even if he did develop/show shmptoms as he gets older	0

1211552889799430144	I have an autistic 6 y/o nephew as well. No major scares given so far. But it’s always beyond me how my sister in law manages it all pretty much single handedly with so much grace! https://t.co/fjvELS5Y9Z	0

I keep seeing horror stories of women missing out on the first 2 months of their newborn's life from testing positive for COVID-19. I can't even imagine. I pray I avoid it. Seriously, that would be a nightmare	0

1147101480467488768	@NonMaternalMum My older son had his tongue tie clipped. You did the right thing mama. Sometimes not getting a tie clipped, depending on severity, can result in speech delays and/or impediments. You’re doing a great job!	0
1238924872635613186	Nothing offends me more than when people ask “what’s wrong” with Easton when he won’t talk and then proceed to say “bless your heart” when I tell them he’s autistic.... I never complained? So why are you feeling sorry, our life is great, he’s a WONDERFUL boy ❤️💆🏻‍♀️	1
1392922227927097353	This thread makes me so sad. I’m so thankful we had the tools and information to start signing with my speech delayed kiddo at 15 months. I can’t imagine knowing it was an option and refusing to use something that could help my child communicate. Sign Language is language. https://t.co/JGo2ftzecr	1
1092989901103079424	I seriously don’t know why modern day parents that are part of the antivaxxer movement are more paranoid about their child having ASD or having some sort of LD rather than worrying about the probability of burying their child from these diseases coming back. #Vaccinateyourkids	0
1455059618560888833	the best thing a parent of a child with autism and/or adhd can do is seek help and “treatment” for their child. none of this “let a child be a child” or “that’s just how he is” bullshit. what happens when they grow up?	0
1265643092302069765	@IcedBrunette So horrible. I could never imagine giving up on a kid. I work with a very severely autistic kiddos and I just could never ever imagine giving up on them EVER. ESP.

1268978183455588357	One happy boy right after meeting Santa last Christmas! He was so overjoyed to finally meet Santa. Years before, he would not have been able to stand in line; but after years of hard work, patience, and therapy I got him there. Good moms UNITE! #Autism https://t.co/Vykrxjxbv1	1
1458299883132125189	@andrew_the_pom My daughter is 6, and while she doesn't have a diagnosis yet, I suspect autism. She melts down a lot when she's overstimulated. She doesn't get aggressive, but she falls into a puddle of tears. I struggle with this sometimes because I feel like I'm doing everything wrong.	0

1188811182460882944	@Cotamae I’ve never encountered anyone who brings up autism, and if they do it’s never their biggest concern. It’s them just saying that known reactions mimic the symptoms of autism. Never that they are concerned with their child becoming autistic due to vaccines.	0
1283665038725677062	This girl said people with disabilities never “bother” when many of the kids she’s referring that “bother” her with tantrums could very likely have ASD since autism is common af 🤷🏽‍♀️ ( just using her words. I don’t think they bother)	0
1471432586098585600	@salhogg I am so worried for all our little children. The lockdown effect is so profound I realise. Are you seeing more language delays? What can I do with my 18 month old to help?	0

1102568636559122437	I'm so thankful that my son doesn't have autism. I know that sounds awful - but with my brother having fairly severe autism and my husband being on the spectrum it's always been a fear of mine that my children would face the struggles that they do.	0

1113210561607688192	We’ve snuggled all day. His vocabulary is exploding and he can sing so many recognizable words to Frozen now. But he’s so much more than a little boy with autism. He’s the little boy that stole my heart. https://t.co/LPADRWhMjp	1
1377301175037530117	@SamPatten86 @commaficionado Prior to diagnosis, I took 4 courses dealing with autism in young children and in retrospect, they were entirely pro-ABA, and the whole time I thought, I would never put my kid through this. Now, I’m even more appalled at the stuff that’s considered appropriate for autism.	1
1070884763345477633	i don’t get how you can say you love your child but act like this. instead of trying to press that “vaccines cause autism” and wanting to “end autism” why not promote ABA therapy, OT, speech, resources in various states, etc. https://t.co/P0vTe8AF0g	0

968197468864286721	This is absolutely heartbreaking! Please, please go to the hospital if your child is having an asthma attack and can't be seen by a GP. They will be seen immediately! Zac was put on oxygen by our GP instantly and rushed to the hospital in an ambulance  https://t.co/wvj6cgtOfA	1
1100673247681617920	Maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of ADHD among offspring up to 3-fold. The higher the cotinine levels are in the mother’s blood during pregnancy the greater is the child’s risk of developing ADHD later in life. via /r/science https://t.co/IishgnDRmy	0
1389557048103378947	Like just shut your fucking mouth because you have zero ground to stand on. Just because your friend microwaved a taco while pregnant and gave birth to a beautiful autistic boy doesn’t mean we stop warming up our food.	0

1041871705772195840	Tonight I saw an autistic boy who works at a local store in town walking home in the rain. I was in the opposite lane but I turned around and offered him a ride home. He was so grateful and so kind. I needed that so bad. I’m going to bed with a grateful heart. ♥️	0

977624795457163264	My heart hurts for the kids 2-3 that you still see with bottles/pacifiers and are non-verbal. Now I’m not talking about disabilities, I’m taking about LACK of parental CARE. Believe or not, the first few years of their life significantly impact the rest of their lives.	0
1396248555791265794	Now I know why people always think they kid has adhd.  These kids are always moving, on go, at all times. It never ends! I’m not saying my kid does have adhd but BOY SIT DOWN SIT DOWN SOMEWHERE! 😅 Sheesh!	0

1101552297023365122	@Karebear1794 It doesn’t offend me at all. My son has autism and It’s because he was BORN WITH IT. Not because he is vaccinated. If that were the case, my daughter would end up being autistic, also. Annddddd she isn’t 🙂 it’s a genetic thing. Not because of vaccines.	1

1131155692788830208	A client said her family doesn’t believe in vaccinations not because of autism but because if the baby is processing the medicine he isn’t developing in other areas during that time and that it’s very scientific m... Then asked if I needed a doula. Lol I’m so good.	0
1156625530709561344	@RedStateBlonde @livefreeordeb I don’t even want my kids taking ADHD meds. Let kids be free of meds as long as possible. My pediatrician tries not to over prescribe antibiotics because you build up a tolerance. Take a confused kid and give them hormones, I think it increases their problem more then helps it	1
1414320653776326668	Secondly, the my son is high risk. He is a toddler who has already been in the hospital multiple times for asthma and covid will surely put him back in, as said by his doctors. So please do not tell me kids don’t get sick. 2/	1

1471454876068630528	I have big respect to moms of nonverbal kids. While my kids are currently nonverbal they will likely be able to speak to me one day and deciding what symptoms your kid is feeling is so hard. Like do you want to go to school today, dude? You love it but do you feel ok?	0
1264836388433903616	@JaneCanDoSE4 @lionel_stanhope Reading that the son is autistic, therefore totally excusable to go to family.

1243844968298491904	@aimliverpool @HeinzUK @ADHDFoundation @LivPaCL8 @Autism @flagupautism Unable to help as live in Kent but I hope they manage to find soon. Often with autism it is sensory issues that cause problems with food. When a child's diet is very limited they may also have ARFID which is usually caused by a food phobia and very little trust in foods good luck	0

1453295807126556673	Anyway, I took Cloud and tiny son to the park and Cloud went and made a fuss over a lad who, I think, had high functioning autism.

1083357412193497088	@ComfortWeight @ClumsyHotMess @champagnefiance @ExecutiveSlave People think that the evil vaccines are passed from mom to baby. I've seen people say like if your mom was vaccinated you could still have that in you and that's what causes autism in new babies that haven't had vaccines. It's ..... abhorrent	0
1122986856747024385	@localhoodgypsyy @missbethanymae I get that 100% but autism isn’t a death sentence, diseases can be and are usually fatal in children. In the case that you do end up with an autistic child, there’s plenty of things that can be done to help them prosper and live as normal a life as possible. You get me?	0
1126873821682831361	@bethanyrae__ This kid in MIDDLE SCHOOL told me he didn’t want to sit by me because I was from the Rez and had lice. So I scratched my head and touched his hand.

1303686831670730752	@hayisforbb @MJacksonFae @taylor_gundry @jacobccfisher Therapists do, in these circumstances absolutely.
